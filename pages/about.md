**The International Kovilan Study Group** is concieved as a group of people, loosely bound together with the thread of love for literature in general and the works of Kovilan in particular. Kovilan, as everyone knows, occupies a special, unique and not easily assailable position in the highest plateau of Malayalam fiction. By his inimitable style of sharpening words, rather than softening them, he carved a niche for himself, far, far away from the eyes of casual onlookers of the world’s literary scene. His stories, he said, were meant for readers more intelligent than himself. And there indeed weren’t many of them when he was still living.

Born of peasant parents in1923 in Kandanissery, a village of hills and plains in central Kerala, in south India, Kovilan began his literary career at an early age. His first known work, Thakarnna Hridayangal (Broken hearts), a long story, that came in 1946, itself showed signs of the indelible mark he was to make later in Malayalam story telling. From the very beginning, even before starting to write, he had assigned himself the difficult task of paving a new path for him to go along. Other writers’ ways were simply not fit for him. His stories never imitated themselves, in style or in content. He took with him only those readers who were willing to delve into the secrets of words writers create. Naturally he was left mostly unread.

The Study Group proposes to find out and gather together Kovilan enthusiasts from across the world using cyberspace as the meeting place. The main objective of the Group is, needless to say, to study, promote and propagate the literary works of Kovilan. Anyone who is interested can join and contribute his/her might.

M.T. Vasudevan Nair, noted Malayalam litterateur, is the patron of the Group which is formed under the initiative of K. A. Mohandas (Chavakkad), K. V. Subramanian (Guruvayur), Dr. A. Haridranath (Kolkatta), A. Purushothaman (Mumbai), K.R. Vinayan (Hyderabad), Venu Edakkazhiyur (Guruvayur), P. Shamsudheen (Doha), Dr. K.S. Ravikumar (Sree Sankara University, Kaladi) and M. A. Rahman (Kasaragod).

As a part of formalisation of the Group, a constitution has been drafted and posted elsewhere in this site for discussion. Final constitution will be posted as and when it is ready.

They are also requested to send articles on Kovilan and other related literary matters for inclusion in the site. The articles may be emailed to the co-ordinator of the Group in the above address.
